# Top Projects Finder App

#Prerequisites - Have vue, node, npm, yarn, vue apollo, vuetify install

This application is made with Vue.js, Vue Apollo for integrating with graphQL and Vuetify for styling (my first time using vuetify so apologies in advance if there's less than perfect styling)

##To run the app locally
CD into the application folder and run these commands in your terminal:
(if something doesn't work- try running npm install first assuming you have npm- https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

1. yarn install (if you do not have yarn installed already you may need to run 
			 npm install -g yarnpkg@0.15.1 
In command line and then run 'yarn install')
2. yarn run serve

This should get the app running on port 8080 - if encountering issues please contact skunlong@gmail.com
